# BlueSky Lists

Bluesky lets you define [starter packs](https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs) with list of
recommended accounts and feeds to follow.

The problem with starter packs is there isn't a way to collaborate on them.

We can solve that problem by storing the source of truth for our lists in a git repository and then using
a tool such as the CLI [bsky](https://github.com/mattn/bsky) to follow all the accounts listed in a YAML file.

This respository contains some lists I'm curating for communities I belong to i.e.
* Platform engineering
* AI Engineering
